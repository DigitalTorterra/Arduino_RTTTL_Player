# Arduino_RTTTL_Player

This project shows the process for creating an MP3 player-like device using an Arduino. The device has capacity for volume control, pause/playback, and can store several songs. It uses a Python 3 script to compile RTTTL songs into Arduino C code which allows the device to import any such song.
